# Game Design Specification (GLI-19 Compliant)

This document highlights key game-design requirements from the GLI-19 standard, focusing on game mechanics, RNG, payouts, and player-facing elements. The goal is to ensure fairness, transparency, and regulatory compliance in interactive gaming systems.

## Random Number Generator (RNG) and Game Outcome
- **Unbiased RNG:** All game outcomes must be determined by a verified RNG. The RNG source code and any scaling/shuffling algorithms must be reviewed to detect bias, errors, or hidden controls【21†L1531-L1539】.  
- **Statistical Testing:** RNG output (post-scaling) must be tested (e.g., chi-square, runs, serial tests) to confirm it matches the intended distribution and that results are independent between draws【21†L1545-L1553】.  
- **Outcome Usage:** The game must use RNG results as-is unless the design explicitly restricts them. It must not discard or alter RNG outputs based on previous outcomes or to create "near-misses"【23†L2418-L2427】【23†L2428-L2435】. For example, if the RNG chooses a losing outcome, the game cannot swap it for another losing outcome just to mislead the player【23†L2428-L2435】.  
- **Independence:** Events of chance within the game must be independent. The game cannot adjust bonus frequency or theoretical return based on past plays【23†L2436-L2444】. No external factors (like network speed or linked devices) may influence RNG behavior【23†L2436-L2444】.

## Payouts, Odds, and RTP
- **Minimum RTP:** A house-banked game must have a theoretical Return-to-Player (RTP) of at least 75% over its lifetime, unless a higher threshold is mandated【24†L2561-L2564】. This applies under any fixed bet or line configuration (including skill games, using optimal play)【24†L2570-L2578】. If the game’s RTP would fall below the minimum (e.g., some lottery games), the displayed RTP must reflect the actual value and meet the RTP display requirements【24†L2561-L2564】【24†L2589-L2592】.  
- **RTP Display:** If RTP is shown on the game interface, the standard requires: (a) explaining how RTP was calculated (min/avg/max) and how players can achieve it【26†L2608-L2616】; (b) for skill-affected games, basing RTP on an advertised or optimal strategy【26†L2608-L2616】; (c) disclosing how jackpots or timed bonuses contribute to RTP【26†L2608-L2616】. If RTP is actual (historical), the number of plays and time period used for calculation should be stated【26†L2608-L2616】.  
- **Highest-Pay Odds:** The chance of winning the single highest advertised prize (purely by chance) must be at least 1 in 100,000,000. If it is more frequent, the actual odds must be displayed to the player【26†L2630-L2637】. (This excludes multipliers from features or incentive awards.) If the top prize can occur in a bonus game, the odds must include the probability of triggering that bonus【26†L2630-L2637】.  
- **Payout Limits:** Any limitations on prizes (e.g., merchandise, annuities, maximum cash) must be clearly explained on the game’s help or paytable【26†L2648-L2652】.

## Progressive and Incrementing Jackpots
- **Definitions:** A progressive jackpot grows with player wagers; an incrementing jackpot grows with specified game events as defined by the rules【28†L3189-L3198】. Games with such jackpots are covered by GLI-19’s jackpot section.  
- **Display:** The current jackpot amount (in credits or currency) must be shown to all players eligible to win it【28†L3209-L3218】. If the jackpot is a “mystery” (hidden prize), special “mystery award” rules apply instead (not covered here).  
- **Updates:** The jackpot display must update at least every 30 seconds to reflect new contributions【28†L3216-L3224】. If the display has a maximum value (ceiling), the rules require a reset mechanism and handling of overflow (e.g., a secondary pool) when the ceiling is reached【28†L3223-L3225】.  
- **Winning the Jackpot:** When a jackpot is won, the player must be informed and paid by the end of the game【30†L3278-L3282】. The full jackpot amount is awarded (no truncation or rounding, except possibly into a rollover) and all contributions remain credited towards the new jackpot【30†L3278-L3284】. If the game uses a credit meter in currency units, the jackpot can be added there when applicable (with correct currency-to-credit conversion)【30†L3281-L3285】.

## Player Interface and Information Display
- **Interactive Elements:** All clickable buttons or touch areas that affect gameplay or outcomes must be clearly labeled【9†L1790-L1798】. There must be **no hidden buttons or tap zones** that influence the game, unless explicitly allowed by the rules【9†L1798-L1802】.  
- **Displayed Info:** During play, the interface must always show: player’s available balance, current bet amounts (and all active bets or enough info to derive them), and any special wager options in effect【12†L1925-L1933】. After each game, until the next spin, the screen should display the last game’s result, the amount won, and any wager options used【12†L1935-L1942】.  
- **Paytable and Rules:** The help or paytable screen must include all game rules and possible winning combinations with their payouts【13†L2003-L2011】【13†L2021-L2023】. Min/max bets and all bet options (including multipliers) must be shown or derivable【13†L2017-L2023】. The paytable must indicate whether prizes are in credits or cash【13†L2021-L2026】. Any prize advertised in the game art (free spins, item rewards, etc.) must be clearly explained and achievable through the game or feature【13†L2023-L2026】.  
- **Clarity and Accessibility:** All instructional text (including audio prompts) must also be visible on-screen【14†L2048-L2053】. Text must contrast with its background for readability【14†L2050-L2055】. For example, rules involving card or symbol combinations must specify how overlapping wins are handled (e.g., if a straight flush is counted as both flush and straight)【14†L2056-L2064】. If symbols change function (like a symbol that becomes Wild during bonus), the interface must make this clear【14†L2084-L2092】.  
- **Game State Info:** If multiple pieces of info (instructions, promotions, etc.) share the screen, they can alternate, but each item must be displayed long enough to read【9†L1814-L1821】.

## Game Rules and Mechanics
- **Complete Rules:** The game must provide unambiguous, complete rules and artwork for how the game is played【13†L2003-L2011】. This includes any bonuses, free spins, autoplay, timers, symbol transformations, community awards, etc. All such features must be described on accessible screens before any wager is required【13†L2003-L2011】.  
- **Bet Limits:** All betting options (min, max, increments) and any restrictions must be stated or clearly derivable【13†L2017-L2023】.  
- **Multiple Bets:** In games with multiple independent bets (multi-wager games), each bet must be shown clearly and which bets have been placed【41†L2161-L2164】. The win from each bet, and the total win, must be displayed so the player can associate each payout with its bet【41†L2164-L2170】.  
- **Line Games:** For games with multiple pay lines, the screen should display which paylines are active【41†L2179-L2184】. The number of lines wagered and the bet multiplier for each line must be indicated (or be obvious from the display)【41†L2188-L2194】. Rules on how wins multiply with line bets and any line restrictions must be clearly shown【41†L2188-L2194】.  
- **Transparent Payments:** The paytable/artwork must clearly state how overlapping wins are paid. For example, if multiple winning combinations occur on the same line or through scatter symbols, it should say whether all wins are paid or only the highest【14†L2060-L2068】. If a payline has non-linear payouts (varying by bet), the artwork must convey all possible payouts【41†L2188-L2194】.  
- **Random Event Probabilities:** Any random event in the game (like drawing a card or random reel spin) must have a constant probability unless the rules explicitly say otherwise【24†L2555-L2560】. If simulating a real casino game, the odds should match the real game (e.g., a specific roulette number is 1/38 on a double-zero wheel)【24†L2542-L2551】.  

## Bonus/Feature Requirements
- **Progress Tracking:** If a feature (bonus game) requires collecting symbols or achieving goals, the player’s current progress and remaining requirements must be displayed【26†L2653-L2660】【37†L2675-L2683】. For example, if 3 of 5 symbols are needed, the interface must show that progress in real time.  
- **Bonus Mode Indication:** The game should clearly indicate when the player is in a bonus mode【37†L2675-L2683】.  
- **Hold and Respin:** If the game allows the player to hold reels, cards, or symbols for a respin/draw, the held elements must be clearly marked and the player given a clear way to change their hold selection【37†L2675-L2683】.  
- **Unchanged Odds:** When a bonus requires multiple events (e.g., multiple spins or steps), the probability of triggering each remaining event should not decrease over time unless stated in the rules【37†L2684-L2692】.  
- **Multi-Spin Counter:** If the bonus consists of a fixed number of spins or draws, a counter must be shown (e.g., “Spins remaining: X”)【37†L2691-L2694】.  
- **Player Interaction in Bonus:** A game offering an interactive bonus must not auto-run the bonus without player consent. Exceptions: if the player explicitly chooses to auto-start (e.g., by pressing a “Start Bonus” button)【37†L2698-L2707】, or if the bonus has only one action (allowing a timed auto-start after at least 2 minutes)【37†L2698-L2707】. In community bonuses involving multiple players, any auto-selection delay must be clearly communicated to all players【37†L2698-L2707】.  
- **Additional Bets in Bonus:** If continuing a bonus requires placing extra bets, the player should be given the option to opt out【37†L2723-L2731】. If a temporary “win meter” is used to accumulate bonus winnings, the game must allow the player to transfer funds from it back to the credit meter to continue playing if needed【37†L2723-L2741】, and then transfer all stored winnings to the credit meter after the bonus ends【37†L2730-L2741】.  

## Session Flow and Game Cycle
- **Game Selection:** The platform must clearly list all available game themes【11†L1853-L1861】. When a player selects a game, the interface must indicate the chosen game. The player should not be forced into a wager immediately upon game selection; unless explicitly stated, the player must be able to return to the game menu before betting【11†L1853-L1861】.  
- **Game Cycle:** A game cycle begins when a player places a bet or presses "play" and ends when the round’s outcome is resolved and credited【12†L1896-L1904】【12†L1905-L1911】. All bets are subtracted from the player’s balance at cycle start, and winnings are added at the end【12†L1896-L1904】【12†L1905-L1911】. A cycle includes any triggered bonuses, free games, or additional wagers within the same round【12†L1896-L1904】.  
- **Sequential Play:** A new game cycle cannot be started until the previous cycle is fully completed and all funds and history have been updated【12†L1912-L1918】. An exception is allowed if, for example, a large jackpot win is being manually verified by the operator【12†L1912-L1918】.  
- **Displayed Information:** During a session, the game screen must display the player’s current balance, denomination, all active bets, and any bet options chosen【12†L1925-L1933】. After each game, the exact outcome and amount won should be shown (until the next game or until the player exits)【12†L1935-L1942】. These details can also be reviewed via a separate “Game Recall” feature if cleared from the main display.  

## Interrupted Games and Recovery
- **Definition of Interrupted:** A game is interrupted if it ends unexpectedly (e.g., communication loss, device restart) before a final outcome is delivered【32†L3419-L3427】.  
- **Bet Handling:** Wagers for interrupted games must remain held by the platform until resolution【32†L3448-L3452】. The player’s account must reflect any funds tied up in an interrupted game.  
- **Resumption Mechanism:** The platform must allow the player to resume an interrupted game. For single-player games requiring input, the player should be returned to the exact state before the interruption to continue【32†L3455-L3464】. If no player input is needed (e.g., final random draw), the game can auto-complete to a valid outcome and update the balance accordingly【32†L3455-L3464】. In any case, an interrupted game must be resolved before the player can start a new round of the same game.  

## Player Accounts and Security
- **Age and Identity Verification:** The system must collect PII during registration and verify the player’s age (only legal-age players may play)【17†L575-L583】. Identity verification (through the platform or third-party service) must confirm the player’s name, address, and date of birth, and check exclusion lists before allowing play【17†L575-L583】【17†L601-L610】.  
- **Single Account:** Each player is allowed only one active account (unless otherwise approved by the regulator)【17†L623-L631】. Players must agree to terms, not share their account, and consent to monitoring during registration【17†L575-L583】.  
- **Authentication:** The platform shall support multi-factor authentication and allow players to update credentials securely【17†L623-L631】. Local game software must be identifiable by version and should validate critical components on load; if validation fails, the game must prevent play and display an error【19†L815-L824】【19†L828-L834】.  
- **Transaction Logging:** Every financial transaction (bets, wins, deposits, withdrawals) and game action should be logged with timestamps for auditability. This ensures a full audit trail of all player activity and game history.  

This specification extracts the core requirements from GLI-19 relevant to game design. All points above are drawn from the GLI-19 standard to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance in interactive game design【9†L1790-L1798】【23†L2428-L2435】【24†L2561-L2564】【28†L3216-L3224】【32†L3455-L3464】.
